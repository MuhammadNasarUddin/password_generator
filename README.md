This program is a password generator created using Streamlit in Python. It provides users with an interface to generate secure passwords. Users can set the desired length of the password (between 4 and 50 characters) and choose whether to include symbols. Upon clicking the "Generate Password" button, a strong password is created using a combination of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and optionally symbols. The generated password is displayed for the user to copy and use as needed, enhancing their online security by creating unique and robust passwords for various accounts or systems.
